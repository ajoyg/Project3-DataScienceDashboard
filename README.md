### Problem Overview
Navigating the job search process can be time-consuming and challenging, particularly when it comes to determining suitable roles and setting realistic salary expectations especially for careers in data science.

### Introduction
Our goal is to create a dynamic dashboard that offers job seekers in the data science field the ability to explore a wide range of roles tailored to their specific preferences and priorities. By incorporating customizable filters, users can personalize their search based on factors such as work experience level, job title, location, and availability of remote work option. This tool will enable job seekers to approach job interviews with informed salary expectations and help them make more informed career decisions.
